# README - open sourced to hack the planet

# "Got to Git Git Git Git Git Git Git..."

This is my first Git Repository so I will not claim that my kung fu is anywhere near 
yours...but don't let that fact go to your head.

* This only includes my dive into the pool of ZSH.  It will include I am sure the trials and 
tribulations of going from a BASH world to BASH on Crack world of ZSH.  Suggestions are welcome.

Peace and Love
